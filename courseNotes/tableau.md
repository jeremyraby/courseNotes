# How to Use Tableau Public

## Worksheet Interface

On the data pane (far left), non-numerical data columns are found under the **dimensions** field and numerical data columns are under the **measures** field.

- You can drag and drop measures to dimensions and vice-versa.

Blue highlighted data columns are discrete data and green are continuous.

The analytics tab of the data pane allows you to cool stuff like add trendlines to scatterplots.

## Making Vizes

Tableau automatically creates a date hierarchy for any date field. When you drag the date "pill" to the Columns shelf, `YEAR` is defaulted, but clicked the `boxed +` symbol in the left of the pill, you can get smaller time periods (like quarter, etc).
