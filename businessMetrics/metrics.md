# Asking the Right Questions

Metics are numbers that allow us to ask the right business question and can be impacted when business practices are changed.

What can be done right now to increase revenue, maximize profitability, or decrease risk?
- "right now" is relative
  - could be real-time with automated reports or after results of an A/B test are compiled

Sales tax isn't a metric because it can't be impacted by changing business practices; "click-through-rates" of an ecom website can be impacted by a number of factors, making it a metric.

# Classifying metrics

All business metrics can be classified into 3 broad categories which can be identified by asking "Who cares about this information?"
- Profitability
  - Efficiency, logistics, operations
    - Fastidious perfectionists
  - Anything relating to cash tied up in unsold inventory
    - How well is the product produced? Is there waste in the process?
    - Is there insufficient production to meet demand? How many products are returned/defective (raw numbers and a percentage of the whole inventory)?
- Revenue
  - Sales & Marketing folks
    - Optimistic extroverts
  - Everything that relates directly to selling a product
    - How well the company is selling their products
      - How many of X were sold over y time? E.g. first quarter of this year compared to first quarter of last year.
        - May also want to know sales by region, product, salesperson, new vs repeat customers
    - How effective is X marketing campaign?
      - How many people have seen Y advertisement? What percentage have responded to the ad?
        - Maybe also "X by" region, demographic, etc as it could help better target ads?
- Risk
  - risk managers, creditors/investors
    - Informed skeptics
  - It all comes down to leverage - highly leveraged companies = more risk
    - Something like a recession can make it hard to pay debts and turn the company insolvent.
    - "Net cash out" is the most important metric to track.
    - "Churn rate" is how many new subscribers drop the subscription within a year.
      - High churn leads to fewer potential **new** customers
      - Long-term customers decreases reliance on converting prospects into customers = less risk

## Traditional vs Dynamic Metrics

Dynamic = significant change within 30 days
- Can the business significantly change this metric within those 30 days?

> Profit != cashflow. An unprofitable company can stay afloat for years (Amazon, Twitter) but must have enough cashflow to pay the bills.

> Too much success too quickly is a bad thing (not enough cash on hand to meet demand)

> "Economies of Scale" = rising marginal profits on higher sales and production volumes
> - Econ. of Scale = inverse relationship between fixed costs and variable costs
>  - Lower variable costs relative to fixed costs = higher econ of scale

"Net 60" payments = retailers pay wholesaler 60 days after first shipment to give them time to actually sell the product
"Negative float" = the time it takes from purchasing raw materials (usually Cash On Delivery) to getting paid by the customer (Net 60 + production time)
- Many businesses operate on negative float
- Insurance companies operate on postive float - getting paid "now" to deliver services "later"

Account receivables = money owed to us by the customer which have not yet been paid (refer back to Net 60 and Negative Float)
- Tracked by "aged account receivables" --> how long it's been that the customer has owed us money for services

## Revenue Metrics

### Key Enterprise Sales Metrics

[Sales funnel with example ecom KPIs]()

Number of X over time ...
- New leads
- new qualified leads
  - have the budget AND plan to purchase something like your product
- Expression of Interest
- Met the decision maker
- Soft circle sale
  - decision maker says "yes"
    - several things could go wrong and end the sale here
- Actual, binding contract, sales

## Profitability Metrics

### Inventory Management

One of the primary ways to reduce costs and maximaize profitability

Inventory = completed product waiting to be sold
- the more time spent waiting on a shelf the less efficient the company is the less profit they stand to make

#### Why inventory matters

The more negative float you have the more interest is paid on debt
Fixed Costs of Storage -> the longer a product sits on a shelf, the more that product costs to store as fraction of the fixed cost
- Kind of like the cost of a pair of boots decreases each day you wear them, but opposite
Waste - > some products lose value the longer they're on the shelf and some lose all value (complete wastage, eg anything [like food] with an expiration date)
Obsolescence -> the longer a product stay in inventory the more it risks never being sold for any number of reasons
- out of fashion, improved technology, supply/production < demand

### Metrics

Average number of days inventory (days inventory)
- Can be estimated for any publicly traded company
  - Must publish annual reports
    - Includes 
      - "inventory on hand at end of year"
      - total annual cost of goods sold over the year
        - both inventory on hand & total annual cost are calculated similarly = apples to apples comparison
        - (Inventory / annual cost ) * 365 = average days inventory
- Doesn't tell us anything about seasonal items or other "slow" selling items, returns, etc
- Inventory turn around & days inventory are both tracked at individual SKU level
  - by region
  - by store
  - done by tracking date reordered by store management and date it's delivered and stocked then compared against cash register data which tracks datetime sales data by SKU

Expected day's inventory vs actual day's inventory should be closely monitored
Number of times over X time period the inventory of Y item reached 0
- Too few items stocked means customers won't be able to buy the item
  - Keep at least 1 on the shelf
- Customers should be asked if they weren't able to find anything
- Proxy measurement
- Higher volume of unit sales is directly proportional to the potential lost revenue due to 0 inventory

## Risk Metrics

Leverage and risk to reputation
- Too much leverage means you eventually won't be able to pay bills
- Tracking buyer demographics and getting contact info can help track product recalls and actually improve/maintain reputation
  - Chipotle has had problems with this, for sure, but I'm curious about Tesla with all the self-driven cars crashing?

## Key Performance Indicators

All KPIs are metrics, but not all metrics are KPIs

A KPI must be
- Measurable
- Directional (increases/decreases)
- Directly related to business goal

### Primary & Secondary KPIs

Primary KPI directly measures whether you're on track to meet your goal
Secondary KPI is related to the primary KPI but doesn't confirm if goal has been met

> If you want to run a marathon in under 4 hours, you need an average mile pace of 9:10 or faster. Pace is the (primary) KPI you can track over time. Distance and total time would be secondary KPIs as they don't directly affect your goal.
