# Excel

## Shortcuts

- `Cmd + arrow` keys jump to first/last cell in that column (up/down) or row (left/right)
- To copy worksheets to new workbooks
  1. Create a new workbook
  2. Right-click the old sheet you want copied
  3. Select "Move or copy"
  4. Select the new workbook from the "To book:" dropdown
- `Shift + arrow` keys will select multiple individual cells
- `Cmd + Shift + arrow` will select multiple cells at once
- `Fn + Ctrl + left arrow` will make A1 the active cell
- Fill series, in the Edit group will allow you to auto fill rows or columns based on some constant interval, eg 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
- Excel has "lists" of things that are commonly used and will be included in an autofill situation. Monday, Tuesday.../Jan, Feb... are examples. You can make a "Custom list" for serials of commonly used items, like listing the X-Men:
  1. Open the Excel menu in the top left of the window
  2. Excel --> Preferences --> Formulas and Lists --> Custom Lists
  3. Add in your list. Can be typed in manually or added from a range of cells
- `Fn + F4`, when in a formula will add `$` for absolute references. Multiple presses will cycle through relative, mixed, and absolute references

## Helpful stuff (& things)

- Named cells
  - Helpful for naming a cell which can then be referenced as a constant in a formula
    - Compound interest formula can be done with named cells
